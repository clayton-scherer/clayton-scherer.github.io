          Here are some of the projects I have been working on! All projects
          were developed using an Agile work methodology, test driven
          development and of course, clean code!

            This was a console based application that mimicked a hospital
            database. The user started out viewing a custom menu that they could
            navigate to see: records for the staff and their abilities, the
            patients and their statuses, as well as being able to exit at their
            leisure.

            This was a console based application that allowed the player to
            interact with virtual pets through our shelter system. Players could
            feed, play and bathe their pets while making sure to keep the
            shelter and their pets cages clean!
