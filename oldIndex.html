            Here are some of the projects I have been working on! All projects
            were developed using an Agile work methodology, test driven
            development and of course, clean code!

            <p>
              This was a console based application that mimicked a hospital
              database. The user started out viewing a custom menu that they
              could navigate to see: records for the staff and their
              abilities, the patients and their statuses, as well as being
              able to exit at their leisure.

            <p>
              This was a console based application that allowed the player to
              interact with virtual pets through our shelter system. Players
              could feed, play and bathe their pets while making sure to keep
              the shelter and their pets cages clean!

            <p>
              This was a fullstack MVC application that mocked a review site,
              similar to Yelp, but with memes. Users had the ability to create
              tags, categories and authors as well as the ability to post
              reviews.

        <h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
        <p class="bio">
          I attended The Ohio State University before I made the commitment to
          enlist in the United States Marine Corps. I served four years on
          active duty in the infantry with 1st Batallion 7th Marines - Baker
          Company. Near the end of my active service I had been promoted to
          E-5 (Sergeant) and decided to advance in another direction. Then I
          found JavaScript and the rest is history.
